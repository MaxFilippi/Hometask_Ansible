### Unfortunately, I did not complete my homework before DeadLine due to my current work problems and the beginning of my vacation with a hike to the Carpathians without the Internet and laptop (for 1 week)
 
### Current progress:
 - create several VM
 - start  to create playbooks from the beginning with the roles
 - 2 roles are created
 - one role (app) have  as  dep another role (common)
 - role APP is LAMP env
  
 
### Final Idea idea is: LAMP hosts with HAProxy with  Self-signed Cert and as example Wordperss on LAMP hosts.

### I  will finish my hometask latter.
